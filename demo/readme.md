# Interactive Demo

This directory contains a demo where you can test out and compare the performance of the hardware accelerator with a software implementation of the same model. The demo is built using [Gradio](https://gradio.app/), a Python library for creating interactive web applications.

## Running the Demo

Install the project requirements, then from the repo root simply run `python demo/app.py` to start the demo.

We will also provide a ready to go Docker image soon!
